    "\n",
    "In nature, various factors can affect the growth rate of a population. The Allee effect is one such fascinating phenomenon where the effective growth rate is highest at an intermediate population size. This might occur, for example, when a low population finds it hard to locate mates, whereas a large population faces resource competition."

    "One of the key insights from mathematical biology is understanding how various biological phenomena are reflected in the mathematical models that describe population growth. In this part, we are comparing the population dynamics described by the Allee effect equation to the well-known logistic growth equation. Our goal is to observe how different growth dynamics manifest in these two models and what the qualitative differences between them are.\n",
    "\n",
    "To aid in this comparison, we've developed an interactive plot below:\n",
    "\n",
    "The plot displays the rate of change $ N' $ of the population $ N $ as described by both the Allee effect (in blue) and logistic growth (in green). You'll notice that while both curves intersect the x-axis (indicating points where the population doesn't change), their shapes and the implications for population dynamics differ.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Sliders Description:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **r:** Represents the intrinsic growth rate in both models. As you adjust it, you'll see both curves moving vertically. In the Allee effect equation, a higher $ r $ means a higher maximum growth rate before it starts to decline. In the logistic equation, it defines the steepness of the growth curve.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **a:** This parameter is unique to the Allee effect and determines the concavity of the blue curve. As you increase $ a $, the curve becomes steeper, meaning the Allee effect becomes more pronounced. This represents how harshly the population growth rate drops off as $ N $ moves away from the optimal population size $ b $.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **b:** This represents the optimal population size in the Allee effect model. It's the point where the population growth rate is maximized. By adjusting this slider, you're shifting the blue curve horizontally, which effectively changes the population size at which the maximum growth rate occurs.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **K:** Known as the carrying capacity, this parameter is unique to the logistic growth model. It represents the maximum sustainable population in the given environment. Adjusting this slider changes the point where the green curve touches the x-axis.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you adjust the sliders, take note of where the curves intersect the x-axis (these are the fixed points or equilibria) and how the curves' shapes change relative to each other. This will give you an intuitive understanding of the population dynamics described by both models.\n"
